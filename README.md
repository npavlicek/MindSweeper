## Controls
| Key | Description |
| - | - |
| `R` | Regenerate the grid |
| `Esc` | Reveal menu/Hide menu |
| `C` | Reveal the mines |
| `V` | Reveal the whole grid |

## Compilation
I personally used MSVC to create the project and compile it, however, I think it can be compiled using any C++ toolchain as long as it is linked with SFML.

the `res` folder and SFML DLL's must be copied to the `bin` folder to be along side the executable.
